<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles 4x4 Matrixs.

it's got a finite constants values for the preset :
IDENTITY    = 'IDENTITY',
SCALE       = 'SCALE',
RX          = 'Ox ROTATION',
RY          = 'Oy ROTATION',
RZ          = 'Oz ROTATION',
TRANSLATION = 'TRANSLATION',
PROJECTION  = 'PROJECTION';

On wich depends the following arguments respectivly :
IDENTITY    ->nothing
SCALE       -> the scale
RX          -> angle of rotation
RY          -> angle of rotation
RZ          -> angle of rotation
TRANSLATION -> vector ( class Vector ) of the translation
PROJECTION  -> Field of view ( in degrees ), Ratio (width/height of screen), near and far z distances

The following method are providing for this Class:

- mult() : return a new matrix corresponding to the multiplication of the instance by the argument;

- transformVertex() : return a new Vertex corresponding to the matrix apply to the one sent in argument;

There are no setters, so you won't be able to change Matrix's values after creation.

You can enable verbose mode with the static var Vertex::$verbose = True.
